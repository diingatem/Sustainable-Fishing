# Sustainable-Fishing
Sustainable Fishing Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing the "sustainable fishing Cleaning.xlsx" dataset, which includes data related to sustainable fishing practices. The analysis explores trends, summarizes data, and visualizes insights using R.
________________________________________
File Descriptions
1. Dataset: sustainable fishing Cleaning.xlsx
•	Contains raw data on sustainable fishing practices.
•	Columns include demographic information, fishing behaviors, and perceptions about sustainable fishing (replace with actual column names if known).
2. R Script: analysis_script.R
•	R script for importing, exploring, and visualizing the dataset.
•	Performs the following:
•	Data exploration and summary statistics.
•	Analysis of numeric and categorical variables.
•	Visualization of trends (e.g., histograms, bar plots, grouped analyses).
3. README File: README.md
•	Provides instructions for setting up and running the analysis in R.

Prerequisites
Required Tools:
1.	R: Install from CRAN.
2.	RStudio (optional): Recommended for better coding experience.
Required R Packages:
Install the following R packages if not already installed:
R
Copy code
install.packages(c("readxl", "tidyverse", "skimr"))

Instructions for Analysis
Step 1: File Setup
1.	Place the dataset (sustainable fishing Cleaning.xlsx) and R script (analysis_script.R) in the same working directory.
2.	Open the R script in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
Step 2: Running the Script
1.	Adjust the file path in the script if necessary:
R
Copy code
file_path <- "sustainable fishing Cleaning.xlsx" 
2.	Replace placeholder column names (column_name, category_column) with actual names from the dataset.
3.	Execute the script line by line or run the entire script.

Outputs
1. Summary Statistics:
•	Numeric variables: Mean, median, min, max, and distribution.
•	Categorical variables: Count of responses.
2. Visualizations:
•	Histograms: Distribution of numeric data (e.g., age, income).
•	Bar Plots: Frequency of categorical data (e.g., responses to survey questions).
•	Grouped Bar Plots: Trends by groups (e.g., demographic groups vs. fishing practices).
3. Cleaned Data:
•	The script can save a cleaned version of the dataset as sustainable_fishing_cleaned.csv:
R
Copy code
write_csv(data, "sustainable_fishing_cleaned.csv") 
________________________________________
Customization
•	Update column names in the script to match the dataset.
•	Add or modify visualizations for additional insights.
•	Extend the analysis to include correlations, statistical tests, or predictive modeling.
________________________________________
Troubleshooting
•	Missing Packages: If a package is missing, install it using:
R
Copy code
install.packages("<package_name>") 
•	File Not Found: Ensure the file_path in the script points to the correct location of the dataset.
•	Errors with Column Names: Check for typos in column names and update them in the script.

Notes
This project focuses on basic analysis and visualization. For more advanced analyses (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing), extend the R script or consult additional R resources.
